> ### **Sentiment Analysis: Tweets**
> - Collected Twitter data received from **Twitter API**, and stored this data within my own `database` using `R`, `pgAdmin4`, and `postgreSQL`.
> - Generated and executed `SQL` **queries** to `filter` and `join` data.
> - Cleaned and analyzed data, conducted a **sentiment analysis** and a **word correlation** analysis.

## **❓ Research Objectives** 
> This project was a way to learn about and implement several new ways to use `R`.
> 
> > **I. Collect data (Tweets) from Twitter using `R`**  
> > > A. Clean the data with `R`  
> > > B. Store all the data in a `postgreSQL` *database*  
> > 
> > **II. After a period of data collection, use R to connect to the database**  
> > > A. Use `SQL` to query the *database* via `R`  
> > > B. Store `SQL` *query* outputs as data frames for `R` analysis 
> >  
> > **III. Investigate insights in the data**  
> > > A. **Sentiment analysis**  
> > > B. **Word correlations**  
> > > C. Create **visualizations** showing both the sentiment and correlations. 
> >
> With all of those objectives in mind, my deliverable for this analysis is a `Quarto` website made in `R`, hosted via `GitHub Pages`.
## **💡 Inspiration**
> I wanted to see what other people were saying about the same topics I am interested in, and I also wanted to see if others were saying more positive or negative things about each respective topic. Those topics being: **Rocket League**, **Pokémon Go**, **TopGolf**, and the hashtag "**#rstats**".  
> I picked **Rocket League** and **Pokémon Go** because I enjoy playing these games. **TopGolf** because I am currently working there as an *IT Team Lead*, so I thought it would be interesting to see this topic as I am not very aware of the wider public perception of the player experience. “**#rstats**” I picked because I wanted to have one hashtag included in this topic group, and I have not yet investigated the hashtag in detail. This will let me see more about the Tweets with this hashtag, and the common themes that involve each other.
